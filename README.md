## Project Description

10xCards is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) web application designed to solve the main barrier to using spaced repetition learning methods - the time-consuming process of manually creating flashcards.

The application uses GPT-4o-mini to generate question-answer pairs from user-provided text, then manages the learning process using the proven SM-2 algorithm with a simplified binary rating system (Remember / Don't Remember).

### Key Features

- **AI Flashcard Generation**: Paste text (1,000-10,000 characters) and let AI generate flashcard proposals
- **Staging Area**: Review, edit, accept, or reject AI-generated flashcards before saving
- **Manual Flashcard Creation**: Create custom flashcards with Front/Back format
- **Spaced Repetition Learning**: SM-2 algorithm-based study sessions with optimal review scheduling
- **Flashcard Management**: Full CRUD operations with search and pagination
- **User Authentication**: Email/password authentication with private data access (RLS)
- **Progress Tracking**: Reset learning progress for individual flashcards or entire database

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Astro 5** - Fast, efficient pages with minimal JavaScript
- **React 19** - Interactive components where needed
- **TypeScript 5** - Static typing and IDE support
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling
